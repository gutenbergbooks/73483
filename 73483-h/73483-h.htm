<p class='ni'>Don’t go wonderin’ if I’m a expert
on the subject, but ain’t
there a kind of girl that looks her
prettiest when she’s wearin’ a kitchen
dress and rollin’ out biscuits? And ain’t
there another sort of girl who transforms
herself into the most beautiful
when she appears in a filmy evenin’ gown
and waits for you to waft her out into
the moonlight? Then there’s another
that becomes the one and only when she
is wool from head to toe and cuddlin’
beside you on a toboggan. And there’s
one who is a shade above Venus when
she comes slashin’ out of the surf glistenin’
and lithe and fresh.</p>

<p>Jane Alton wasn’t any of these kinds,
but, oh, what a dream she was in a
flyin’ suit! Jane was born to ornament
the air. With a stick in her hand and
flyin’ joy in her eyes, she was an angel&mdash;and,
of course, bein’ an angel, she belonged
in the sky. She put herself there
every chance she got!</p>

<p>It was a mornin’ full of smooth air and
high visibility when Jane came rompin’
around the hangars, shinin’ leather all
over and, seein’ us, smiled brighter ’n
the sun and ran straight for our plane.</p>

<p>Ned Knight was in the fore cubby,
jazzin’ the motor, ready for a take-off.
He grinned and remarked over his
shoulder:</p>

<p>“Benny, ol’ nut-twister, here’s where
you lose your seat, back there. Jane’s
all set to take another trip to her home
port, Heaven, and there’s no use tryin’
to stop her. Better start gettin’ out.”</p>

<p>I’d already begun startin’, and I was
all the way out when Jane came up
laughin’.</p>

<p>“Thank you, you ol’ darlin’,” she said
to me, and I ain’t so old, either. “I
can’t wait another minute to get up into
all that glorious sky. Ned, would you
mind changin’ back to Benny’s seat?”</p>

<p>“What!” barked Ned. “Listen, Jane.
I’m takin’ this little Alton up for a
check-ride. Your Dad is waitin’ for the
data on it. Just this time won’t you ride
in back, just this once, and lemme&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ned Knight,” came back Jane, “am
I not the holder of a pilot’s license?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you, my only instructor,
pronounced me to be a flyer equal to any
other you know?”</p>

<p>“You sure are, Jane, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can’t I handle that stick and do a
good job of gatherin’ data myself?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sayin’ you can’t, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to go up in another
plane, <i>without you</i>, Ned Knight?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Ned, and so he began gettin’
out!</p>

<p>Me, I couldn’t ’ve held out half that
long against Jane Alton. I was plenty
crazy about that girl, but bein’ only a
grease-monkey, and havin’ a map resemblin’
a mauled-up bulldog’s, I confined
myself to bein’ just her slave. Ned
Knight, however, being the best flyer in
the state, and the handsomest in six, got
a lot of time from her. I suspected
maybe that there was some kind of romance
goin’ on there, between the flyer
and the daughter of the plant owner,
’cause they flew a lot together, those two.</p>

<p>So, with Ned back in the rear pit, Jane
climbed into the front one, settled to the
controls, jazzed the motor, and waved
one tiny gloved hand to me. I socked
the blocks; she stepped on the gas; and
the Alton was off. It trundled to the
other edge of the sand, and Jane pulled
it up neatly; she circled twice, got herself
a nice lot of altitude, rode a few air
waves in sheer joy, and then deadheaded
across the blue.</p>

<p>Now and then she cut the motor.
Say, there wasn’t any tellin’ what went
on between them two, all alone up there,
so close to Heaven! I know they didn’t
exactly dislike the open solitude of that
sky! I remember once, when Jane
hopped out of the Alton, after a spell of
hootin’ with Ned, she said to him: “I
<i>love</i> to be all alone with you up there!”
And Ned was never quite the same when
he came down from a flit with Jane,
anyhow!</p>

<p>Well, while the Alton was banking
and skimming at about a thousand, Robert
Bennett Alton himself came out onto
the field. He was owner of the field,
and of the factory where the Altons were
made. He was manufacturing a sturdy,
speedy, almost foolproof plane that was
just about the ultimate in aviation on a
small scale. A man dissatisfied with
anything short of perfection&mdash;that was
Alton. And a fine man, in and out from
the heart. He stood beside me, watching
his little moth weave across the sky.</p>

<p>“What a ship!” I said. “What a joy
of a ship!”</p>

<p>“It seems to handle well, Benny,” was
all Alton said. “What&mdash;what’s that?”</p>

<p>Starin’, I went cold. From the front
of the plane some black smoke spouted
out; and then came the flashin’ of fire.
Fire it was! The nose of that plane was
bein’ licked by the flames leapin’ back
from the engine. One second it had
been all o. k., and the next it was
pushin’ a bonfire through the sky! If
the fire reached the gasoline lines and the
tank&mdash;if it kindled the linen&mdash;it meant
disaster! And I, myself, I had inspected
that ship to make sure it was o. k. All
but passin’ out, I continued to stare, and
Mr. Alton got as white as the clouds.</p>

<p>“Benny, who’s pilotin’ that ship?”</p>

<p>“Jane!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>Now the plane was sideslippin’ away
from the flames; it tore off them, and
they disappeared.</p>

<p>“And Jane knows her stuff!” I
shouted.</p>

<p>Once havin’ snapped away from the
danger, Jane dove at full throttle, but the
fire flashed out again, worse than before.
As soon as it did, Jane sideslipped again,
and the wind put the fire out. This time
when she recovered she banked steep,
gradually losin’ altitude and made for the
T. Mushin’ out, she cut the gun, and the
Alton glided for the sand. The fire
popped out again, not so bad this time,
but bad enough!</p>

<p>The burnin’ ship trundled in, and before
it stopped Ned Knight was out of
it. Jane jumped right behind him. Ned
scooped up sand and threw it on the fire,
and Jane worked just as fast. Mr. Alton
and me and some of the other boys
ran for the ship, but by the time we got
there, the fire was all out.</p>

<p>Ned Knight, plenty mad, stepped up
to me chin first. “Benny, your job is to
keep these ships in trim, ain’t it&mdash;’specially
this one, that’s goin’ to fly the race&mdash;or
was! Then how come the timin’ is
off, and fire got sucked back into the carburetor?
I’ll bet my hat that the screen
and drain is in bad shape, too, you&mdash;.
Good gosh!”</p>

<p>“Well, I got it out all right, didn’t I?”
inquired Jane, who seemed to think that
any scrape wasn’t very bad if she got out
of it alive.</p>

<p>“You sure did! You got us out like a
veteran. Jane, you’re all right. Benny,
dang you&mdash;”</p>

<p>I wasn’t wastin’ time standin’ there
and bein’ bawled out. I put my head
into that motor, and it took only a minute
for me to find out that some monkey
business had been goin on&mdash;grease-monkey
business! The engine had been
tampered with. Our pet Alton! The
ship we were dressin’ for the race! And
with Jane in it! Lord!</p>

<p>I whirled around and barked out my
troubles. And then there was plenty
of quiet for a minute.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Ned Knight moved first. Some
other members of the hangar crew
had come out to share the excitement.
He singled out a pilot named Stud
Walker, and stepped right up to him.
Ugly eyes that man had, and an ugly
face, and an ugly heart&mdash;Walker. His
eyes sort of flashed with fear, and he
tried to back away, but Ned had him
nailed.</p>

<p>“Walker, lemme ask you some questions!
Last night, while I was fussin’
around the field, I heard somebody inside
this Alton’s hangar. That was strange.
By the time I got it unlocked, and went
inside, the noises stopped, and the hangar
was empty. But I found a hole in
the sand, under the tin wall, that was
fresh dug, and that hole was hid by two
empty oil barrels. You know anything
about that? I’ll answer for you. You
know <i>all</i> about it. You’re the man that
tampered with the plane!”</p>

<p>“You can’t prove&mdash;” Walker gulped.</p>

<p>“Your guilty face proves it for me!
I’m goin’ to smash&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ned began to sail in with both hands
and feet, but I grabbed him. While he
was talkin’, two other greaseballs had
got behind Walker, and blocked his retreat.
Also, they kept Ned from killin’
him. And right then Mr. Robert
Bennett Alton himself stepped up and
spoke.</p>

<p>“Ned, if you’re accusin’ this man of
tamperin’ with that plane, I hope you can
prove what you say.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Alton,” Ned came back, “some
time ago I caught Walker tappin’ a gin
bottle on the field, and ever since then
I’ve been watchin’ him. A few days ago
he acted funny. I watched closer. After
dark a sedan drew up, and Walker got
in. The car stayed, and I watched it.
Inside it was Gifford, at the wheel&mdash;Gifford,
of the Stormbird people. He and
Walker were talkin’ low. Then I saw
Gifford pass money to Walker. That is
proof enough for me that he’s in Gifford’s
pay, working against us. He was
clever enough to jim the plane so I
couldn’t find the trouble last night, but
he’s got now!”</p>

<p>Walker looked plenty sick. Alton
looked at him, and he couldn’t look back.
He might ’ve killed Ned Knight and
Jane&mdash;Jane!&mdash;with his trick, done for
pay. He couldn’t face the man that had
hired him out of good faith.</p>

<p>“Walker, you look guilty!” Alton
spoke up. “You’ve tried to cripple us in
favor of the Stormbird people&mdash;so they
can win over us, of course, in the air
derby tomorrow. Thank the Lord you
won’t have a chance to get in any more
of your dirty work! The Stormbirds
are so afraid that we’ll outfly them that
they have to hire crooks to beat us, eh?
Do you know, Walker, that you could be
jailed for what you’ve done?”</p>

<p>Walker was white around the gills.</p>

<p>“Walker, I don’t want to bother with
you. I think too little of you and what
you’ve done to prefer charges against
you. Now, Walker, get off this field.
Get off! If you show your face on it
again, man, I’ll break you with my bare
hands!”</p>

<p>Alton didn’t usually say much, but this
was plenty for the occasion, and he
meant every word. Alton’s contempt
was worse than a lickin’ for Walker to
take. Let loose, he shambled away,
looks of disgust and hate followin’ him.
When he disappeared around the hangars,
the field seemed like a better place
to stay.</p>

<p>Mr. Alton spoke quietly now to the
boys, askin’ ’em to look over the planes
careful, suggestin’ that a guard be put
around the hangars tonight so that
nothin’ could happen to the planes before
the start of the air race the next
day; and they’d better keep a gun handy;
and&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ned!” Jane called out, not bein’ able
to hold herself in any longer. “Please,
let’s get another plane out and go right
back up!”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>“Jane,” Mr. Alton said, “I want to
talk with Ned a little, so you’d
better let the flyin’ go a while. Benny,
is that ship damaged much?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” I answered. “By adjusting
the timer and putting in a screen, and
some new ignition wires&mdash;they’re burned
off&mdash;she’ll be shipshape again.”</p>

<p>“Start on it right away,” Mr. Alton
told me. “Ned, how did the ship feel
today?”</p>

<p>“Better than ever before,” Knight answered.
“Jane was at the stick, but I
could feel the pull of the new prop. We
get the proper revs now when we’re
climbing.”</p>

<p>“The stabilizer?”</p>

<p>“Works like a dream. The ship’s as
steady as a Rolls Royce on Fifth Avenue
and she stays that way. Also, it’s easier
to hold her head up. And the ailerons
can be used when she’s throttled way
down&mdash;that’s somethin’ that’s improved
with the new prop and stabilizer. She’s
ready for any race now, Mr. Alton.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said the Boss.</p>

<p>The boys’d been helpin’ me to roll the
plane tail-to into the hangar, and then,
leavin’ Mr. Alton, Jane, Ned and me in
there alone, they went back to work. I
tore off the old ignition wires while Mr.
Alton talked.</p>

<p>“Ned, are you ready to fly your best
tomorrow? Goin’ to reach Curtiss ahead
of all the other entries, are you?”</p>

<p>“Sure he is!” spoke up Jane. “I’m his
mascot!”</p>

<p>“I think your plane is a better flyer
than any other in the line-up, Mr. Alton,”
Ned answered. “The Stormbird
will tail us, but we’ll win.”</p>

<p>“I hope so!” Mr. Alton came back,
sighin’. “Ned, I’m goin’ to take you
into my confidence. You’re goin’ to
pilot that ship tomorrow, and Benny will
be along with you, and you both ought
to know that I’m bankin’ on you boys
heavily. Aside from the purse&mdash;which,
of course, the pilot is goin’ to keep, for
he’s the man that is goin’ to earn
it&mdash;the reputation of the Alton is at stake.
The number of accidents that have happened
recently in Altons has given us a
black-eye, Ned&mdash;you know that.”</p>

<p>“People’ll forget that when we zip
across the finish field first,” Ned answered.</p>

<p>“They will&mdash;if we win,” Mr. Alton
answered. “That will help. But that’s
not all. That ill will has hurt our business.
We have been runnin’ on a shoestring&mdash;and
we’ve just about reached the
end of it. We need the winnin’ place in
this race because of the good it will do
our business. If we don’t come in
number one, Ned, I’m afraid that we’ll
have to be closing up the plant soon.”</p>

<p>Ned got pale, and I forgot work, and
Jane listened plumb excited. Mr. Alton
was talkin’ in a low, serious tone. Since
the Alton plant was all any of us had
in life right then, it was serious. We
knew business had been bad, but we
never suspected it was that bad&mdash;never
suspected that this air derby was becomin’
a life and death matter for Alton
planes.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain a little more,” Mr. Alton
went on, solemn and quiet. “You know
that the United Airways is holding up a
large order of planes&mdash;enough to keep us
busy for the better part of a year&mdash;and
will place its order dependin’ on the outcome
of the race tomorrow. They’re
lookin’ for speed and stamina, and they
think they’ll find it in the winnin’ ship.
I had a talk with Finley, the manager,
last night. ‘Win the race, and I’ll place
my order with you,’ he said. That’s how
the matter stands. And that United order,
if we get it, will save our lives.”</p>

<p>Lord!</p>

<p>“There are other orders in the balance,
too,” Mr. Alton went on. “The
government is going to give the winner
some places in the air mail and border
patrol fleets, to replace the antiquated
DeHavilands. There’s a passenger airport
in Texas that I’ve been tryin’ to
land, that’s waitin’ for the winner to take
the order away from it. I could name
half a dozen more such examples; but
it isn’t necessary.</p>

<p>“You understand, Ned, that when you
fly tomorrow, you’ll be flyin’ to win&mdash;win
not only the purse for yourself, but
a new life for us. And if you lose&mdash;but
we won’t think about that now. You’re
goin’ to win.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Ned. “We’re goin’ to
win!” He gave a look at Jane, and
Jane’s eyes sparkled. “There’s still another
reason why I’m goin’ to win, Mr.
Alton!”</p>

<p>“There is?”</p>

<p>“A pilot that ain’t married usually
hasn’t got a habit of savin’ his money&mdash;and
I’ve spent all mine, till lately. But
if I had to buy a house and a lot of furniture,
right now, I couldn’t do it. But
with that purse in my pocket&mdash;five
thousand dollars&mdash;it wouldn’t be so
hard! I want to do that, Mr. Alton. I
want to win that race, and then step up
to you, and say, ‘Sir, I want to marry
your daughter!’”</p>

<p>Mr. Alton smiled. “From Jane’s conversation
at home, which has just two
subjects&mdash;flyin’ and Ned&mdash;I’d suspected
the situation.” He chuckled. “I’d
rather have a pilot for a son-in-law than
anybody else, and of all the pilots I
know, you rate highest with me, Ned.
Well, after you win that race, and step
up to me, and say your say, I’ll talk with
you about it!”</p>

<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>Mr. Alton walked out of the hangar,
havin’ said <i>his</i> say to us&mdash;which was
plenty. For a few minutes I was
stunned. Things was comin’ too fast for
me. That whole big plant, out there,
was in danger of vanishin’. Those
peppy little Altons were in danger of
eventually droppin’ out of the air. Altons
had been the subject of our talk and
dreams for years, and if they went&mdash;it
would be worse than a death in the family.
And yet, there the whole matter
was, flat up and lookin’ us in the face&mdash;
and all of us swore, right then, that this
Alton <i>had</i> to win that race!</p>

<p>I turned and got to work on it&mdash;and
how I began to work!</p>

<p>Somethin’ that happened behind me
sounded a whole lot like a kiss.</p>

<p>“So!” said Jane Alton. “You think,
do you, Ned Knight, that you’re goin’
to win me in a race as though I was a
kewpie doll on a rack?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And if you don’t win the race, you
won’t ask me to marry you at all?”</p>

<p>“Well, gosh!”</p>

<p>“Young man,” said Jane in her most
business-like manner, “I have somethin’
to say to you&mdash;in private!”</p>

<p>She tugged him out of the hangar.
Beyond the doors I could hear ’em whisperin’.
Then they moved away, and I
didn’t see either of ’em again that day&mdash;because
I wasn’t lookin’ at anythin’ but
that plane.</p>

<p>I worked on her like a maniac. I forgot
lunch and dinner and kept workin’
on her till my arms were about ready to
drop off. I wouldn’t let anybody else
touch her. I tested her everywhere,
tuned her to the prettiest pitch she could
give, tightened her everywhere she
would tighten. There wasn’t any dingus
on that plane that I overlooked. When
I called a halt it was after midnight.</p>

<p>Then I put blankets beside her, and
tried to go to sleep; but I couldn’t sleep.
I had to get up and look her over again.
Every half hour after that I was up, to
make sure I’d tested somethin’ that I
thought I <i>might</i> have overlooked. I
couldn’t stay away from that plane. Too
much was dependin’ on it and the shape
it was in.</p>

<p>And at last, as I was for the tenth time
feelin’ over the control wires, I saw
light comin’ through the cracks of the
door, and I knew it was tomorrow.</p>

<p>The day of the Trans-state Air Derby
had come!</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>It was the day of days. All over the
country, airplane makers had been
lookin’ forward to this day, and preparin’
for it. Every maker of light
planes was goin’ to be represented with
the best job they could turn out. A
string of single-motored planes was
goin’ to line up, every one ready to do
its best, and compete for the championship&mdash;and
the competition was goin’ to be
murder! A big Commission was behind
the project, directin’ it. Newspapers all
over the world were runnin’ notices of it,
’cause the results were goin’ to be official;
and the winner’s name was goin’ to
be written right into air history in big
red letters.</p>

<p>There’d been guards outside the hangar
all night; and when a knock came, I
opened the doors. Ned Knight, fresh
and dapper, came in, bringin’ a early
mornin’ paper. He showed it to me.
Splashed all over the front page was big
headlines: <i>Planes Ready For Big Cross
Country Race!</i> There below was the list
of makers: Alton, Stormbird, Zephyr,
Lightning, Ranbros, Impco, and all of
’em. And then the pilot’s name: Alton
carryin’ Ben Benson and piloted by Ned
Knight. Stormbird carryin’ William
Carson and piloted by&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good gosh, Ned!” I busted out.
“That must be a misprint!”</p>

<p>“Nope, Benny; it must be true.
Stormbird’s made a change in pilots at
the last minute.”</p>

<p>Right there in black and white it said
that the pilot of the Stormbird entry
was goin’ to be Stud Walker! Stud
Walker, the self-same crook that we’d
fired off the field&mdash;who had been in
Stormbird pay, and jimmed our plane!
It was easy to see that Stormbird was
usin’ him because Walker would be hell-bent
to beat us out, for our handlin’ of
him. We were goin’ to have a real
enemy flyin’ against us!</p>

<p>“Gosh!” I croaked. “Ned, we can
sure count on Walker’s beatin’ us if he
possibly can. He’ll fly like a wild man
to beat us!”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to do some flyin’ myself,”
Ned came back. “Is the plane ready,
Benny? If it is, we’d better be gettin’
over the field. We’ve got to check in
and get lined up. Mr. Alton has drawn
third place for us.”</p>

<p>“Third? Who’s second and first?”</p>

<p>“Impco is second.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Stormbird is first.”</p>

<p>“Hang it all! They’re gettin’ the
breaks all around. I suppose it figures
out all right in the end, but&mdash;&nbsp;I hate to
have ’em leadin’ us at the very start!”</p>

<p>“Benny, aren’t you goin to dress up?
Those overalls of yours ’re dirty enough
to walk around by themselves.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t change ’em for a suit of
ermine, Ned,” I answered. “They may
be dirty as mud, but I love ’em!”</p>

<p>Then, Ned tells me, we should be on
our way. We roll the plane out, and
block her; Ned gets in, contacts her, and
we pump the prop. She roars off, higher
and higher, and the engine begins to
warm and sing a sweet song. When
she’s hot, she’s the sweetest soundin’
motor I ever heard. Grinnin’ all over
our faces, Ned and I get set. She steps
off down the field, swings into the air,
and away we go, for the startin’ field, as
full of hope as any man could be without
bustin’.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the field slides into view.
There’s a crowd pushin’ around on it,
and lined up, staggered in back of each
other, are planes. We circle and come
down, and taxi smoothly across the field.
Then we ground-loop neatly, and come
amblin’ back. Ned cuts the motor, and
we hop out. For a minute we’re busy
registerin’, and then official greaseballs
push the plane into place, third in the
line.</p>

<p>And there’s the Stormbird, our deadly
opponent, with its nose ’way out in front.
As we come past it, the pilot comes away
from it. It is Walker, lookin’ uglier ’n
ever, with gloatin’ eyes and crooked
sneer. We give him hard looks and
want to go on, but he has somethin’ to
say.</p>

<p>“Yesterday was your innin’, you hooters.
Today is mine. I’m goin’ to fly
you off the map!”</p>

<p>“Not in that wash-tub!” I come back.</p>

<p>“Hush up, Benny!” Ned nudges me.
“Walker, you’re takin’ all the joy out of
this race. We want to fly with real flyers,
not with crooks. Depend on it, man,
we don’t intend to be beaten by dirty
play. And if you fly square, Walker&mdash;
you’ve only primed yourself for the
lickin’ of your life!”</p>

<p>Walker glares a killin’ look at us, and
cusses us out as we pass on.</p>

<p>Then there’s a squeal, and Jane Alton
comes rushin’ around the line of officials,
followed by her Dad. She runs up to
Ned and, right out in public, gives him a
big kiss. She talks fast as a whirlwind,
bein’ all jazzed up with excitement and
hope. Her Dad just shakes us by the
hand and says:</p>

<p>“In a few minutes you’ll be off, boys.
Remember&mdash;we’re goin’ to win.”</p>

<p>We promise him&mdash;our hearts in our
throats. That big Stormbird looks like
a flyin’ devil to us and winnin’ won’t be
a cinch for anybody.</p>

<p>Jane asks, breathless: “Ned, won’t
you <i>please</i> take me along?”</p>

<p>Ned laughs. “No, Jane. It can’t be
done. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please!” she begs.</p>

<p>And he chuckles again, “No!”</p>

<p>Mr. Alton closes in then for a confidential
talk with Ned; and Jane, in a
minute, grabs my sleeve and pulls me a
little bit aside.</p>

<p>“Benny, will you do somethin’ for
me?”</p>

<p>“Jane,” I says, “All you’ve got to do
is ask.”</p>

<p>She pulls me aside a little farther.
“Would you do it for me, even if it
meant a lot to you?”</p>

<p>“Well, Jane,” I say, “I guess I can
equal anybody so far as doin’ things for
you is concerned. You know that.”</p>

<p>She tugs me still farther, and we’re
gettin’ close to the locker room.</p>

<p>“Benny,” she says then, “I want to
fly in this race with Ned.”</p>

<p>I choke up at that unexpected request,
but I might ’a’ known Jane would ’ve
been dyin’ to get up in the air on this
big occasion.</p>

<p>“Gosh, Jane!” I say. “We couldn’t
stow you away. It’d overweight the
plane and hurt our chances to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to stowaway!” she
says. “I want you to let me take your
place!”</p>

<p>Oh, boy! She was askin’ the impossible.
There she was, with her implorin’
blue eyes close to mine, eyes shinin’ with
hope and fire, and beggin’ me, beggin’
me. No, sir, I couldn’t let her do that&mdash;but
there she was, a girl I just couldn’t
refuse if she’d asked for my life. Lettin’
her go up in my place would be a crazy
thing to do, but she kept beggin’ me with
little pleases and won’t-yous, and Bennies,
spoken soft like, and&mdash;Lord!</p>

<p>“If you let me get into your coveralls,
and helmet and goggles, nobody’ll ever
know the diff’rence!” she said.</p>

<p>“Jane, please don’t go beggin’ me!” I
begged her. “It ain’t fair to me. I
can’t resist you any more ’n the tail of
a plane can resist the prop. You know
Ned would blow up if he heard of it,
and your Dad&mdash;and Lord!”</p>

<p>“Benny, it’s the only thing I’ve ever
asked of you; and it means more to me
than anything else in the world right
now. I’ve <i>got</i> to fly in that race&mdash;<i>got</i>
to. Benny&mdash;Benny&mdash;please!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!”</p>

<p>“All you’d have to do is slip into that
private locker and take off those overalls,
and then stay out of sight. I’d just get
in ’em, and climb into the plane, and
stay there. Benny&mdash;please?”</p>

<p>“You can’t do any good up there&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that Ned will fly
worlds better if I’m along with him?
And you want us to win, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” I said. “Well&mdash;here
goes!”</p>

<p>Right then she flung her arms around
my neck, hugged me close, and kissed
me one, two, three times right on the
lips, and said, “Oh, Benny!” And after
that I wasn’t nearly in my right mind.
I dived into the locker, shed my overalls,
and eased out again. With one last
look at her, I dived into the crowd and
lost myself.</p>

<p>Jane hurried into the locker, and in a
minute she was out, in my coveralls and
helmet and goggles. I could hardly believe
my eyes, she looked so much like
me! It was sure astonishin’. She eased
back toward the planes, just when a guy
in a megaphone was shoutin’ the last
warnin’. Jane walked right past Ned
and Mr. Alton and made for the plane.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get into the ship!” Ned
said. “Say, where’s Jane? Ain’t she
goin’ to wish me good luck?”</p>

<p>They looked around for her, while she
was within ten feet of ’em.</p>

<p>“Say, Benny, have you seen Jane?”
Ned hollered at her; and she wags her
head: no!</p>

<p>The last minute is gone; and Ned is
forced to his plane. Jane was already in
when he got there; he climbs in, not
givin’ her any special notice. There is a
poppin’ and roarin’ of motors all around,
up and down the line. Greaseballs turn
the Alton over, and she sings a sweet
tune. The whole line-up is stirrin’ up a
tornado when <i>bang!</i> a shot-gun goes off&mdash;which
means the race is started!</p>

<p>The Stormbird tears off like a maniac,
lifts, climbs steady, and then deadheads
on. Thirty seconds pass, forty, fifty,
sixty. Then, <i>bango!</i> the gun goes off
again, and the Imp plane stretches itself
out across the sand. It lifts, roars,
pulls on, and flies in the wake of the
Stormbird.</p>

<p>Ned Knight bends to his stick and
glues his eyes to the instrument. The
seconds are tickin’ off. Forty&mdash;fifty&mdash;sixty!
<i>Whacko!</i> The gun! Ned stomps
on the gas. Away goes the Alton. It
takes off quick, climbs fast and, roarin’
high, plows into the sky.</p>

<p>And I, back on the field, watch it go
with tears in my eyes!</p>

<p>One by one, at sixty-second intervals,
the planes take off, and soon they’re parading
along the sky, and trailin’ out of
sight. Once they’re gone, there is
nothin’ to do but wait for reports along
the way. The crowd lingers, and I avoid
Mr. Alton. He goes to his car; I just
float around. What’s happenin’ to Ned
and Jane now, I wonder? What’s goin
to happen to ’em as they drive across
half a dozen states. Are they goin’ to
pull onto Long Island and get down to
Curtiss first? Oh, Lord!</p>

<p>Well, plenty happened in that plane on
the way, and this is what!</p>

<p>Ned Knight concentrated on his controls
as he had never concentrated before.
In the back seat Jane just sat and
enjoyed herself. Little by little the Alton
went up to her top speed. With the
throttle gradually opened, she tore
through the sky screaming. With the
wires shrieking, the struts rattling, the
whole plane trembling and throbbing, it
roared on its way, hell-bent for victory.</p>

<p>The string of planes kept goin’ across
the sky spaced like they were at the
take off for a while. At the Ohio line
one of them began to drop, and took to
the ground, disabled, and disqualified,
’cause the race was a non-stop affair.
Another one soon followed. Others
began to draw back a little, and still
others drove ahead a little. And while
Ned was strivin’ to pass the Impco and
reach the Stormbird, Jane removed her
helmet and goggles, and then reached
forward and gently tapped his shoulder.</p>

<p>Ned looked back; for a minute he
thought he was dreamin’. Then he
shouted something that was lost in the
thunder of the motors, and bored on.
He couldn’t snap off the ignition a
minute; ’t would slow the plane. Jane
smiled at him, still enjoyin’ every minute;
and then he looked back again,
and grinned. He’d caught onto the
joy of the thing and then Jane was
satisfied.</p>

<p>Ned bent to his controls again, for
the Impco was slippin’ closer. It wasn’t
bearin’ up under the continued, terrific
strain. Ned grasped the opportunity and
kept the throttle wide open. Bit by bit
the Impco slid back, and Ned gave it a
wide berth. Slowly, but surely, the
Alton advanced. For miles the planes
bobbed side by side; and then the Alton
crept forward, inch by inch, until it was
leadin’.</p>

<p>Jane gaily waved at the Impco pilot
and threw him a couple of kisses!</p>

<p>The Alton bored on, and Ned concentrated
on the Stormbird. It was still
thundering on, a strong ship, much
better than the Imp, perhaps equal to
ours&mdash;perhaps even better! Ned kept
the throttle wide; and Jane settled down
to the serious business of takin’ the
lead.</p>

<p>The earth was bobbin’ below the
planes, slidin’ by gentle but fast; one
town and another came into view and
disappeared. And then the Alton began
to wobble. The motor roared up and
down. Ned was actin’ funny with the
controls. Jane watched him close; and
then she saw Ned’s head bob, and his
shoulders slide forward. Just then the
ship began to dive and lose speed.</p>

<p>“Ned!” Jane screeched, grabbing his
shoulder and shakin’ him. “What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>He pulled himself together some,
looked around; and in his eyes was a
dreamy, sick look. Jane shook him
again; but he acted almost drunk. His
lips mumbled words that were lost in
the motor’s roar; but Jane knew that
something was very much wrong with
him.</p>

<p>The ship was losin’ speed; the Stormbird
was leading by a long distance; and
even the Imp was drawing close again.
Jane didn’t wait for any more trouble.
She unsnapped her safety belt and, calm
as you please, put one leg across and
into the fore pit. Then she pulled forward,
and came into the pit with Ned.
She crammed herself down into and
on him, and grabbed the stick. Ned’s
feet were loose on the rudder-bars, but
the stabilizer kept the plane on an even
keel without much help from the controls.</p>

<p>Jane shook Ned again; and he was
conkin’ out fast. He pulled off one
glove and looked at his right hand. It
was red and swole up, and across it was
a red streak, a scratch. He looked up
with eyes full of pitiful request for help,
and tried to talk. Jane was desperate;
she cut the switch to hear him.</p>

<p>“Sick,” he mumbled. “Scratch&mdash;somebody
on field. Bumped against me.
Must be&mdash;poisoned. Oh,&mdash;I can’t&mdash;go
on&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And he slumped forward in the pit.
Jane snapped on the ignition, kept the
stick steady, pulled Ned back up, and
pleaded in his ear.</p>

<p>“Try, Ned! Try to get up! Try to
get back into the other pit. I’ll handle
the stick. You get back&mdash;try! Please
try!”</p>

<p>Sick as he was, he tried. He dragged
himself up and tottered in the air, while
Jane assisted all she could. Then Ned
tumbled into the rear pit, half on the
seat, and without makin’ a move to get
up, passed out completely.</p>

<p>Jane settled to the controls with all
the fire she had&mdash;which was plenty!
She snapped on the ignition and opened
the throttle wide as she could. The
motor blasted. The plane almost jumped
ahead. The Imp, which was almost
nose to nose with the Alton again, gradually
dropped back. There was the
Stormbird, far ahead. Jane fixed her
blue eyes on that plane, and kept the
throttle open, and prayed.</p>

<p>She didn’t understand perfectly then
what had happened to Ned. It was
this: while he was on the field, talkin’
with Alton&mdash;while Jane was talkin’ with
me, private!&mdash;somebody brushed past
him, and then Ned discovered a scratch
on his hand, lookin’ like it was made
by a pin. He thought nothin’ of it, but
that scratch was full of a drug. What
it was we don’t know yet, but it was
powerful, and without the shadow of a
doubt it had been used by somebody in
the Stormbird people’s pay&mdash;somebody,
probably at Stud Walker’s behest. The
object was to put the Alton out of the
race by cripplin’ its pilot&mdash;and, if it
hadn’t been for Jane, the trick would
have succeeded! But with Jane at the
stick, it was far from succeedin’!</p>

<p>Jane stretched that ship to the limit.
The Imp bobbed far behind. Territory
unreeled under her. The Stormbird
loomed large again. Both ships were
goin’ their limit. The race settled down
to a question of which ship had the more
speed and power and stamina, and the
victor would be decided by a very narrow
margin. Jane kept the throttle wide,
and waited for the Alton to do its stuff&mdash;and it did.</p>

<p>Slowly she drew up. She kept the
Alton on a level with the Stormbird’s
tail for a hundred miles. Then slowly
the differences in the ships began to tell.
The Alton crept up. An inch. Another
inch. Another inch&mdash;forward always,
at a mad airspeed, the motor blasting
like a demon loose out of hell, the whole
ship shaking, the wires screaming. The
earth spun and veered. Another inch&mdash;another.
Little by little the Alton crept
up on the Stormbird until, prop even
with prop, they drove ahead without
either gainin’ a mite.</p>

<p>Once again the Stormbird began to
slip back; and Jane&mdash;yes!&mdash;tossed Mr.
Stud Walker an ironic kiss!</p>

<p>Jane kept that ship howlin’. On she
went. On. The skies began to darken.
The air got a little bumpy. The visibility
dropped. The exhaust tubes of the
planes, white-hot, spouted orange fire.
And Jane drove on. Little by little,
again, the Alton took its margin of lead.</p>

<p>What was that? Water! Long Island
Sound! Only a few miles away was
the finish field!</p>

<p>Jane kept the plane drivin’. The
Stormbird howled on the Alton’s tail.
Both planes were crazy flyin’ things&mdash;crazy.</p>

<p>Then the field, the big square! Closer
and closer! Jane stepped down to it,
slowin’ as little as possible. Down she
swooped, and the ground swung up at
her. She felt the trucks touch. She
zipped across the sand; she ground
looped; she trundled back. And as she
came to a stop, and the crowd started
for her, the Stormbird dropped out of
the sky.</p>

<p>Jane jumped out of her plane. She
knew Ned wasn’t seriously hurt, but
he needed help, and to the first man
she saw she shouted: “Get a doctor!”
Then, with reporters mobbin’ her, she
just smiled, gave her name and that of
the plane, and waited until a fat man
with an official badge, head of the Committee,
came up to her. Then she said
pertly:</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I won, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>The Committeeman was flabbergasted.
He hadn’t expected to see a girl. Reporters
were yowlin’ for Jane’s name,
and facts about her, knowin’ that a
girl hadn’t been scheduled to pilot the
Alton, and sensin’ a big story. The
Committeeman muffed a few words, not
knowin’ what to do or say, but seein’
plain enough that she had got to the
field first.</p>

<p>Then a man in leather tunic and with
goggle-prints around his eyes came
pushin’ through the crowd, with four
other Committeemen, all lookin’ indignant
and outraged. That guy was
Walker&mdash;Walker was howlin’.</p>

<p>“There she is!” he yelped. “This race
is bein’ run on the square, ain’t it?
Well, you can’t rate her winner. She
isn’t the pilot that belongs to that ship.
Her name is Alton&mdash;the pilot registered
for this plane is named Knight!”</p>

<p>The Committeeman got red-faced and
mad and still more dignified. They
waved a hand for silence and bellowed
to the reporters, after a hot and fast
conference among themselves:</p>

<p>“The Alton is not the winner of this
race. The Alton is not the winner! It
is disqualified because of irregularities.
The official winner of the race is the
Stormbird, with Walker pilotin’!”</p>

<p>“Just a minute!” Jane spoke up, pert
and clear. “Where are the irregularities?
The Alton has come through
clean, without any. The pilot of this
ship is supposed to be Knight, and it
wins the race because <i>my name is</i> Knight!”</p>

<p>That’s a poser.</p>

<p>“I intended to fly this ship all along!”
Jane declared. “And I win the
race&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your name is Knight?” the Committeemen
demanded in one big voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Jane. “Mrs. Ned
Knight. It has been that since last
evenin’. So there!”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Whenever I see Jane comin’ onto the
testin’ field of the big, boomin’, prosperous
Alton factory, to take a little sky-spin
with her husband, I size her up and
sigh and tell myself all over again that
that girl sure looks right in a flyin’
suit!</p>
